# Welcome to Community Logs!

To get started you just need a github account and an invitation to collaborate on this repository, following this blog's posting rules any idea can come to life.

## Create post file

Create a new file in `_posts` folder of [CommunityLogs/communitylogs.github.io](https://github.com/CommunityLogs/communitylogs.github.io) repository and 
name it `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` where `YYYY` is current year, `MM` current month and `DD` current day, 
don't use future dates because if so the post won't show, `blog-post-name` could be any name you want but every word must
be separated by `-`.

## Write post content

New created file must start with:
```
---
author: John Doe
facebook_username: john.doe
twitter_username: johndoe
google_username: johndoe
linkedin_username: johndoe
instagram_username: johndoe
github_username: johndoe 
tags: template-post 
image: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103458862/222838288-b2d963e2-8a96-4206-befb-debf134048e9.jpg
---
```
Replace `John Doe` with your name, and your social media `usernames`, social media usernames are not mandatory they are there so people can follow you if interested in your content, delete the specific social media line if you won't provide that social media username. Type just one `tag` with no spaces that describe your post. If you want you can replace `image` default url with an url pointing to an image of your choice. You can write blog posts in whatever language you want, content will be indexed and shown on search engines.

Posts are written in markdown, if you don’t know it, don’t worry, there’s not much to it. See [this post by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn some of the basics.

You can embed images and gifs directly by dropping them in github editor while you write the post and see how the content will be displayed by clicking on the preview tab.

After you created your content you can click on commit to publish your post.

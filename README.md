# Welcome to Community Logs!

This place is open to people who want to express themselves with their unique style and create blog posts of what is on their mind. Could be articles, shitposts, self reflections or technical guides. 
Any idea can come to life on Community Logs following posting rules.

Create a new file in `_posts` folder of **CommunityLogs/communitylogs.github.io** repository and 
name it `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` where `YYYY` is current year, `MM` current month and `DD` current day, 
don't use future dates because if so the post won't show, `blog-post-name` could be any name you want but every word must
be separated by `-`.

Post content must start with:
```
---
author: John Doe
facebook_username: john.doe
twitter_username: johndoe
google_username: johndoe

Questioning about the texture of reality, society and human nature can be seen as getting lost in space. 

This blog is named after 1995's 3D pinball: Space Cadet and Dead Space by Visceral Games.

So if as a human you feel terror of vastness and the unknown, don't worry, go with the flow.

Tilt hard the playground and stomp on space zombies.
